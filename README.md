# Image-Quantization

The idea of Image quantization is to reduce the number of colors in a full resolution digital color image (24 bits per pixel) to a smaller set of representative colors called color palette. Reduction should be performed so that the quantized image differs as little as possible from the original image. Algorithmic optimization task is to find such a color palette that the overall distortion is minimized. 

## Algorithms Used
* Kruskal Algorithm
* K-mean Clustring
* Graphs Algorithm(DFS)
